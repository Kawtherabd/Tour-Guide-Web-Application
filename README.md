# XML Tour Guide System

## Project Overview
This project is an academic web application designed to demonstrate the use of XML technologies in data modeling, validation, and transformation, combined with a PHP-based backend.

The goal of the project is to build a **structured, reliable, and well-organized system** for managing tour guide information, focusing on **data integrity and separation between data, logic, and presentation**.

---

## Objectives
- Design a structured XML data model for tour guide information
- Ensure data validity and consistency using XML Schema (XSD)
- Transform XML data into a user-friendly format using XSLT
- Integrate XML technologies with PHP for dynamic content handling
- Demonstrate a clear separation of concerns in a web application

## Why This Project Matters
This project highlights fundamental software engineering concepts that are still widely used in enterprise and data-driven systems:

- Structured data modeling  
- Data validation and constraints  
- Data transformation pipelines  
- Backend interaction with structured data  
- Clean organization of web application components  

These concepts are essential in domains such as **data engineering, NLP pipelines, enterprise systems, and large-scale applications**, where data quality and structure are critical.
